## Programming highlights

- [ ] Uses custom SQL query and overwrites Backbone’s “parse”method to order blog posts by most recently created and allow page pagination.
- [ ] Stores blogs and posts in Backbone collections to avoid unnecessary database querying.
- [ ] Uses filepicker library to support user photo upload on Backbone views.
- [ ] Implements custom Backbone “CompositeView” class that recursively removes blog or post subviews.


### Bonus Features (TODO)
- [ ] reblogging
- [ ] Click handler on blog titles that outputs an soundbite (ex: a baby waah, a sigh, etc ).
- [ ] like a post
- [ ] tags
- [ ] Automated responses from website when you choose from set of predefined tags. These responses would send words of encouragement
