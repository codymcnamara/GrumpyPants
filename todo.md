steps
  - Pagination
    - use kaminari for pagination

  - Styling:
    - feed show
      - also include blog name somewhere next to the posts
    - create blog
      - it could also be a modal on top of the all blogs page?

  - Random
    - Feed
      - add links on posts to the that post's blog show page
    - decide how to show blog title and blog pic on blog show page
    - could order all blogs by most recent (the same way all the posts are ordered)



After MVP
  - good styling
  - seed data
  - reblogging
  - sad puppy page
  - search
  - click handler on blog titles that outputs an soundbite (ex: a baby waah, a sigh, etc ).
  - deleting posts/blogs
  - comments
  - likes
  - multiple blogs per user
