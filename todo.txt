questions:


-refactoring
  -CJ advice:
    -when user gets created, automatically create a new blog, now model.save will issue a put request
      -then you can have Grumblr.blog
  -toggle logic isn't DRY

styling:
  -how do i get glyphicons or little logos for nav bar?
  -should i put all my css in applicaiton.css file or split it up?
  -i found Tumblr font (Bookman Old Style Bold) but it's not on google fonts. How do i get it?

-is this a sufficient MVP? any flaws?

-how can i implement reblogging?

-should i have somewhere that says the username always, so user knows who they're logged in as?
-why did the "null: false" for post title let a post without a title save to the db?

-where do I find

steps

  -Styling:
    -feed show
      -also include blog name somewhere next to the posts
    -create blog
      -it could also be a modal on top of the all blogs page?

  -random
    -add links on posts to the that post's blog show page
