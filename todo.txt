questions:

-how do i store the currentBlog info, so that it persists like current user? do i have to do some cookie stuff?

-how do i make a backbone logout button?


-should navigation bar be a backbone view?
-TA's suggest doing reblogging over search page.
Should i have an all users page so people people can find blogs to follow?


steps
  -make nav view
  -start styling, figure out modals, (cause new post will be modal)

  -create nav bar
    -build backbone view

    -add logic so "new post" and "my blog" buttons refers to the "current_blog"
    -remove "new post" form from botton of blog show view (it's in nav bar now)
    -need to add dropdown or something for switching between different blogs
      -maybe my blog will have a switch blog button, but then you couldn't just click one button and change
      -maybe instead of a logout button there could be settings button where you can log out or switch blog -let's do this


  -Styling:
    -style the root/login pages
    -create modals for the forms
    -style blog show view


  -all blogs page
    -list of blog titles w/ follow button


  -random
    -format errors so they show up correctly in backbone forms (journal app has good example of this)


currentBlog dilema:

  -one blog per user:
    -when they sign up for Grumblr they'll be redirected to a signin page where they pick the name and picture of their Blog.
      -on submit button for signup, on success take them to new blog page
    -i'd have to make a redirect to other page if people typed in blogs/new in url
      -if it all worked then I could set the blog Id as Grumblr.blogId and access it everywhere
    -find blog by fetching blog collection and searching for blog with user_id === currentUser.get("id")



  -multiple blogs per person
    -after creating user redirect to new blog page
    -nav bar would have 'My Blogs' with drop down list of blogs and "new blog" button at bottom with redirect to new blogs page
    -default blog could be the most recently created blog.
      -So in initialize i could set currentBlog to most recently created
      -if i decide to limit it to one blog i'll just have myBlog link which links to that person's blog. (so there's no link to create more than one blog)

Ashoka's advice
  -add new column to blog table called "default" which is true or false
  -in backbone if they select one of their blogs from backbone, set that as currentBlog
    -how do i send that to info to change which blog is default?
      -guess i could send an ajax request to backbone to change it??


Bonus
-feed show page
  -order feeds by created_at

-format

-add heroku link to read me
