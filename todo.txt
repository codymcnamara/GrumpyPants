questions:

-how do i store the currentBlog info, so that it persists like current user? do i have to do some cookie stuff?
-how do i make a backbone logout button?
if i want to have a logout button in my backbone view, how can I have it access the session logic i wrote in rails? I tried an ajax request but it's not working :/
-has anyone made a logout button as part of a backbone view? I'm trying to have mine access my session logic that i wrote in rails I can't figure out how to do it


-should navigation bar be a backbone view?
-TA's suggest doing reblogging over search page.
Should i have an all users page so people people can find blogs to follow?


steps
  -make nav view
  -start styling, figure out modals, (cause new post will be modal)

  -create nav bar
    -build backbone view

    -add logic so "new post" and "my blog" buttons refers to the "current_blog"
    -remove "new post" form from botton of blog show view (it's in nav bar now)
    -need to add dropdown or something for switching between different blogs
      -maybe my blog will have a switch blog button, but then you couldn't just click one button and change
      -maybe instead of a logout button there could be settings button where you can log out or switch blog -let's do this


  -Styling:
    -style the root/login pages
    -create modals for the forms
    -style blog show view


  -all blogs page
    -list of blog titles w/ follow button


  -random
    -format errors so they show up correctly in backbone forms (journal app has good example of this)


currentBlog dilema:
  -one blog per user:
    -when they sign up for Grumblr they'll pick the name of their Blog


Bonus
-feed show page
  -order feeds by created_at

-format

-add heroku link to read me
