questions:

-should i have somewhere that says the username always, so user knows who they're logged in as?

-why did the "null: false" for post title let a post without a title save to the db?

-for "my blog" nav link i do blog/currentUser.id , i'm guessing that's hacky/bad
-can i make my submit post form method less ugly?


-how do i store the currentBlog info, so that it persists like current user? do i have to do some cookie stuff?

steps
  -*all blogs page
    -list of blog titles w/ follow button
    -make wireframe for new blogs

  -format errors
    -so they show up correctly in backbone forms (journal app has good example of this)

  -order posts on "feed" and "blog show" page by created_at
    -will's idea.
      -add column to posts which holds intrger value of created at
      -in post.rb model, add "after save" callback with method that turns created_at into string and adds it to the new column
      -then use comparator and sort it by that
    -trello way
      -ord column
    -cj way
      -implement unshiftSubview
