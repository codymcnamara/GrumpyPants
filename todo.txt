questions:

-how can i make my submit post form method less ugly?

-for "my blog" nav link can i refactor and make a currentBlog collection method?

-should i have somewhere that says the username always, so user knows who they're logged in as?

-why did the "null: false" for post title let a post without a title save to the db?
-how do i store the currentBlog info, so that it persists like current user? do i have to do some cookie stuff?
