questions:

-should i have somewhere that says the username always, so user knows who they're logged in as?

-how do i store the currentBlog info, so that it persists like current user? do i have to do some cookie stuff?

-TA's suggest doing reblogging over search page.
Should i have an all users page so people people can find blogs to follow?


steps
  -one blog per user
    -validations
      -clear out database
      -change user has_many blogs to has_one blog
      -database level validations?
        -how do i ensure at db level that user only has one blog?
        -validate that user_id is unique (no other blogs have the same user_id)
        -add unique index to user_id on blogs table (do this with a migration)
    -"my blog" nav button

  -finish working on logout button
    -get rid of non-backbone logout button

  -new post
    -have modal close after successful submission, render errors if not

  -all blogs page
    -list of blog titles w/ follow button

  -miscellenaous
    -format errors so they show up correctly in backbone forms (journal app has good example of this)
    -order feeds by created_at
    -use kaminari for pagination

  -Styling:
    -style blog show view
    -style nav
    -style the root/login pages
    -create modals for the forms

After MVP
  -good styling
  -seed data
  -reblogging
  -search
  -comments
  -likes
  -multiple blogs per user
