questions:

-how do i store the currentBlog info, so that it persists like current user? do i have to do some cookie stuff?

-should navigation bar be a backbone view?
-TA's suggest doing reblogging over search page.
Should i have an all users page so people people can find blogs to follow?

    -format errors so they show up correctly in backbone forms (journal app has good example of this)
