      -then you can have Grumblr.blog
  -toggle logic isn't DRY

steps
  -Pagination
    -use kaminari for pagination

  -Styling:
    -feed show
      -also include blog name somewhere next to the posts
    -create blog
      -it could also be a modal on top of the all blogs page?

  -random
    -add links on posts to the that post's blog show page
    -decide how to show blog title and blog pic on blog show page
    -could order all blogs by most recent (the same way all the posts are ordered)

  -click handler on blog titles that outputs an soundbite (ex: a baby waah, a sigh, etc ).
  -deleting posts/blogs
