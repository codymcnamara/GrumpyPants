questions:

-figuring out how to sort posts by created_at
-for "my blog" nav link i do blog/currentUser.id , i'm guessing that's hacky/bad
-how can i make my submit post form method less ugly?

-should i have somewhere that says the username always, so user knows who they're logged in as?

-why did the "null: false" for post title let a post without a title save to the db?
-how do i store the currentBlog info, so that it persists like current user? do i have to do some cookie stuff?
