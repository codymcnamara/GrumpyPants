questions:

-should navigation bar be a backbone view?
-TA's suggest doing reblogging over search page.
Should i have an all users page so people people can find blogs to follow?



steps
  -make nav view
  -start styling, figure out modals, (cause new post will be modal)


  -create nav bar
    -build backbone view

    -add logic so "new post" and "my blog" buttons refers to the "current_blog"
    -remove "new post" form from botton of blog show view (it's in nav bar now)
    -need to add dropdown or something for switching between different blogs
      -maybe my blog will have a switch blog button, but then you couldn't just click one button and change
      -maybe instead of a logout button there could be settings button where you can log out or switch blog -let's do this


  -Styling:
    -style the root/login pages
    -create modals for the forms
